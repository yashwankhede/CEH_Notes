# Ethical Hacking Topics

This README provides an overview of various ethical hacking topics along with explanations and relevant commands.

## Introduction to Ethical Hacking

**Explanation:** Ethical hacking is the practice of intentionally probing computer systems and networks to identify security vulnerabilities and weaknesses. It is performed with permission to secure systems.

## Foot Printing and Reconnaissance

**Explanation:** Footprinting involves gathering information about a target system, which is essential for planning an attack. Reconnaissance is the process of actively seeking information about the target.

## Social Engineering

**Explanation:** Social engineering is manipulating individuals to reveal confidential information or perform actions. It's not a technical topic but a psychological one.

## Scanning Networks

**Explanation:** Scanning networks involves discovering live hosts, open ports, and services running on a network.

## Port Number and its Services

**Explanation:** Ports are logical endpoints for communication. Different services use specific port numbers for data exchange.

## IDS and IPS

**Explanation:** Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are security mechanisms to detect and prevent unauthorized access or attacks.

## nslookup, dig, and Protocols

**Explanation:** "nslookup" and "dig" are DNS query tools used to retrieve DNS information. Protocols refer to communication standards.

## Wireshark, Intro to Burp Suite

**Explanation:** Wireshark is a network packet analyzer. Burp Suite is a tool for testing web application security.

## Types of Hackers, Phases of Hacking, Proxy Servers

**Explanation:** There are different hacker categories, hacking phases (Reconnaissance, Scanning, Gaining Access, Maintaining Access, Clearing Tracks), and proxy servers for anonymity.

## Topology, Traceroute

**Explanation:** Topology is the layout of a network. "Traceroute" is used to map the path of data packets in a network.

## Fping, Topology, Google Dorking

**Explanation:** "Fping" is a faster version of "ping." Topology refers to network structure. Google Dorking is using advanced search techniques.

## Burp Suite

**Explanation:** Burp Suite is a popular web vulnerability scanner and proxy tool.

## cPanel & WHM, Port Numbers

**Explanation:** cPanel and WHM are web hosting control panels. Port numbers are used for accessing these services.

## Car Hacking

**Explanation:** Car hacking involves manipulating the electronic systems in vehicles for various purposes.

## WSL Installation

**Explanation:** Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) allows running Linux on Windows.

## Nmap with Flags and Installation

**Explanation:** Nmap is a powerful network scanning tool. Flags are used to specify options.

## Bruteforcing, GitHub

**Explanation:** Bruteforcing is attempting to guess usernames and passwords. GitHub can host repositories with sensitive data.

## Cryptography, Malware Threats

**Explanation:** Cryptography involves securing data through encryption. Malware threats refer to malicious software.

## Cloud Computing, Directory and Subdomain Enumeration

**Explanation:** Cloud computing involves using remote servers. Enumeration is listing available resources. Directory and subdomain enumeration are important for discovering targets.

Please note that specific commands may vary based on your operating system and tools available. Always ensure you have proper authorization and legal permissions when conducting ethical hacking activities.
